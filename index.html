        <h3>What is Water Wastage and how does it occur?</h3>
        <p>Water wastage refers to the unnecessary or excessive use of water that exceeds the actual requirements, leading to the depletion of water resources. It can occur in various ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Leakages: One of the most common causes of water wastage is leaks in pipes, faucets, and other water infrastructure. These leaks can go unnoticed for a long time, resulting in a significant loss of water.</li>
            <li>Over-irrigation: In agricultural practices, over-irrigation or inefficient irrigation methods can lead to water wastage. Using more water than necessary for crops contributes to unnecessary depletion of water resources.</li>
            <li>Inefficient water use: In households, inefficient water use, such as leaving taps running while not in use, taking long showers, or using outdated appliances, can contribute to water wastage.</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Water Wastage</h2>
        <p>There are various reasons for water wastage, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leaky faucets and pipes</li>
            <li>Overwatering gardens and lawns</li>
            <li>Long showers</li>

        <p>A leaky faucet or tap can be caused by various factors, and it's important to identify the specific cause to fix the problem effectively. Here are some common causes of a leaky faucet:
            ul>
            <li>Broken Washers</li>
            <li>Water Pressure</li>
            <li>Deteriorated Valve Seat</li>

    <section id="overwatering">
        <img src="overwatering.jpg">
        <p>Over watering is another cause of water wastage,Over-watering the lawns can lead to soil erosion, attract pests, and promote the growth of unwanted plants, such as weeds. To avoid these issues, it's important to follow guidelines for watering lawns. In general, lawns should be watered no more than two to three times per week, depending on the soil type and climate.</p>

    <section id="scarcity">
        <img src="waterscarcity2.jpg">
        <p> Water scarcity is major effect which is caused by water wastage. In many areas, there are not enough water supplies to meet the needs of agriculture, industry, and household consumption. This can lead to droughts, decreased crop yields, and even water shortages for human consumption. Lack of access to clean drinking water can have a significant impact on public health, particularly in developing countries. </p>

        <img src="rainwater harvesting.jpg"
        <p> Rain Water Harvesting is the one of the most effective technique to save water. It is the process of collecting and storing rainwater for later use. This method helps to conserve water resources and reduce dependencies on municipal sources.</p>
        <p> Rainwater is collected from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir with percolation, so that it seeps down and restores the ground water.</p>
